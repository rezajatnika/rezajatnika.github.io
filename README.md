My website source code, powered by [Jekyll](http://jekylrb.com) and hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com).

## Layout and Theme
Layout and theme based on
[Solar Theme for Jekyll](https://github.com/redwallhp/solar-theme-jekyll), with
some modification on layout and typography.

Fonts:

- [Meslo](https://github.com/andreberg/Meslo-Font), great font for monospace type.
- [Lora](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Lora), very readable serif font.
